## Description 

My “Work-Day Schedule” is designed for anyone who has to schedule their time in a concise, automated format facilitating the efficient storing and retrieval of Data.  Life can move extremely quick in modern times, and this “Work-Day Schedule” helps to establish an automated resource for compiling important dates and events.   Missing Deadlines and Appointments can be detrimental in the business world.  Fixing this problem is the primary motivation behind building this project.

## Installation

To install this App, you have to open up the Application inside the Browser.  Then the Work-Day Schedule will autonomously calculate the time-of-day and dsiplay the current time shaded in red.  

## Usage

When you access the application through the Browser, the Work-Day Schedule will autonomously calcualte the time-of-day and display the current time shaded in red.  The times that are in the future will be shaded green, while past times are shaded grey.  If you type anything into the shaded input area of the Application and press the blue Save Button, the information inside the shaded input area will be stored until it is overwritten with new material.  


## Credits

Code has been borrowed from the University of Penn’s LPS Coding Bootcamp.  I have modified the original formula to produce the unique results of this project.

## Tests

Title: Work-Day Schedule

I have tested this throughout the course of eight hours multiple times.  I could have moved the moment.js time back or forward, but I wanted to test it exactly as it is meant to be used.  The hours moved approriately, and refreshing the page has continually placed the correct hour shaded in green.   

This Work-Day Schecule does not require any special conditions to run, but running tests on it through multiple days assures me that this Application has the ability to work under multiple conditions.
